# dot_profile
This package holds my personal profile config. Note that I go a little different way than e.g.
Ubuntu goes by default. As I use both bash and zsh on different machines but I like to have almost
the same configuration on both machines I handle most of my settings to the `~/.shellrc` file which
will then be sourced either by the '~/.zshrc' or the '~/.bashrc' respectively.

This way I have the same configuration no matter whether I work on the machine via ssh or login
locally.

## Installation
### Manual installation
This repository is prepared to be used together with gnu stow. See [Brandon Invergo's
explanation](http://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html)
on how to use it. In short

```
mkdir ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
git clone https://github.com/fmauch/dot_profile.git
stow dot_profile
```

This will create symlinks for the dotfiles specified in ```dot_profile``` relative to your home
folder.

### Automatic installation
I personally use a shell script to install all my dotfiles at once that clones multiple repositories
and calls stow on them. You find it in my [dotfiles repository](https://github.com/fmauch/dotfiles).
The installation would then be

```
cd
git clone https://github.com/fmauch/dotfiles
cd dotfiles
# You might want to have a look at this to see which modules this will pull.
./install.sh
```
